Usage: LogFinder [OPTION]... [PATTERN]...
Searches for supplied PATTERN(s) in files matching log types supplied in
".logfiles". PATTERNs follow Java regular expression syntax.

[OPTION]
-h	--help			This help file
-v	--version		Display program version
-d	--directory		Searches supplied directory instead of the default home	
					directory
-l	--log-types		Uses the supplied file to determine log files instead of
					the configuration file	*see [Log Types] below
-o					Changes from default "and" search to "or" search
~~[PATTERN]			Requires that the supplied PATTERN is NOT present in the 
					file

[PATTERN]
Any argument(s) after the options is considered a search pattern. By default
LogFinder will search for each pattern supplied using AND logic; needing all
supplied patterns to be matched in the file for the file to be . You can,
however, use OR logic when you pass the -o option.
Patterns using regular expression syntax will either need to escape escape
characters (\\s instead of \s for a whitespace character) or enclose the regex
in double or single quotation marks.
eg: test\\slog(s)? and "test\slog(s)?" are equivalent
You may also supply patterns prefixed with ~~ to exclude any results that
contain the specified pattern.	

[LOG TYPES]
File types are specified in either PROGRAM_DIR/.logfinder/.logfiles or a file
supplied with the -l or --logfiles option. Both regular expression and glob 
syntax are supported. Glob syntax must be prefixed with "glob:". Regular
expression syntax may also be specified with the prefix "regex:", however, this
is optional.

[DIRECTORIES]
unless you specify a directory the program will attempt to read a file located
in either /etc/logfinder or C:\Program Files\Logfinder with directories to 
search. if it is missing or damaged you can use X to recreate it
